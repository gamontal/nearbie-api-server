This is a fork of Shane Girish's bcrypt-nodejs

Native JS implementation of BCrypt for Node.

Has the same functionality as [node.bcrypt.js] expect for a few tiny differences.
Mainly, it doesn't let you set the seed length for creating the random byte array.

This code is based on [javascript-bcrypt] and uses [crypto] to create random byte arrays.
